## UML(Unified Modeling Language)

1. **Purpose**
   * Standard visual modeling language
     * modeling business and similar processes
     * Analysis design, and implementation of software-based systems
   * The current version is UML 2.5

2. **Classification of UML**

    ![Classification of UML](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-25-diagrams.png)

3. **Struct Daigrams**
   * **static structure** of the system and its parts on different abstraction and implementation levels and how those parts are related to each other.
   * The elements in a structure diagram represent the **meaningful concepts of a system**, and may include abstract, real world and implementation concepts.

   |Diagram|Purpose|Elements|
   |:---:|---|:---:|
   |Class diagram|Shows structure of the designed system, subsystem or component as related classes and interfaces, with their features, constraints and relationships - associations, generalizations, dependencies, etc.|class, interface, feature, constraint, association, generalization, dependency.|
   |Object diagram|	Instance level class diagram which shows instance specifications of classes and interfaces (objects), slots with value specifications, and links (instances of association). Object diagram was defined in now obsolete UML 1.4.2 Specification as "a graph of instances, including objects and data values. <br>A static object diagram is an instance of a class diagram; **it shows a snapshot of the detailed state of a system at a point in time.**" It also stated that object diagram is "a class diagram with objects and no classes." **UML 2.5 specification simply provides no definition of object diagram.**|instance specification, object, slot, link.|
   |Component diagram|Shows components and dependencies between them. This type of diagrams is used for Component-Based Development (CBD), to describe systems with Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).|component, interface, provided interface, required interface, class, port, connector, artifact, component realization, usage.|

    * **Class Diagram**
      * Class diagram is UML structure diagram which shows structure of the designed system at the level of classes and interfaces, shows their features, constraints and relationships
        * associations, generalizations, dependencies, etc.
        * Some common types of class diagrams are:
          * Domain model diagram
          ![Classification of UML](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams/class-diagram-domain-overview.png)
          * Diagram of implementation classes.
          ![Classification of UML](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams/class-diagram-implementation-elements.png)


        * **Association**
          * Association is a relationship between classifiers
            * Class diagram associations
            * Use case diagram associations
            ![Association](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/association/class-association-overview.png)

          * **Association end**
            * A connection between the line depicting an association and the icon depicting the connected classifier

            ![AEnd](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/association/association.png)

          * **Shared aggregation (Aggregation)**
            * It is a "weak" form of aggregation when part instance is independent of the composite.
            * shared part could be included in several composites, and if some or all of the composites are deleted, shared part may still exist.
            ![Aggregation](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/association/shared-aggregation.png)
            * Example
            ![AggreationEx](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/examples/class-example-android-camera.png?ut=151210)

          * **Composite aggregation (composition)**
            * Composite aggregation (composition) is a "strong" form of aggregation with the following characteristics:
              * it is a whole/part relationship
              * a part could be included in at most one composite (whole) at a time
              * if a composite (whole) is deleted, all of its composite parts are "normally" deleted with it.

              ```cpp
              @startuml
              title Relationships - Class Diagram
              class Dwelling {
                +Int Windows
                +void LockTheDoor()
              }
              class Apartment
              class House
              class Commune
              class Window
              class Door

              Dwelling <|-down- Apartment: Inheritance
              Dwelling <|-down- Commune: Inheritance
              Dwelling <|-down- House: Inheritance

              Dwelling "1" *-up- "many" Door: Composition
              @enduml
              ```
          * **Generalization**
            * Directed relationship between a more general classifier (superclass) and a more specific classifier (subclass).
            * generalization relationship is also informally called "Is A" relationship.

            ![Generalization](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams/class-generalizaion-separate.png)
            ```cpp
            @startuml
            hide empty members
            class Accout<<abstract>>
            Accout<|-down-CheckingAccout
            Accout<|-down-SavingsAccout
            Accout<|-down-CreditAccout
            @enduml
            ```
          * **Dependency**
            * Dependency is a directed relationship which is used to show that some UML element or a set of elements requires, needs or depends on other model elements for specification or implementation
            * **dependency is called a supplier - client relationship**
            ![Dependecy](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/dependency/dependency-overview.png)
            * Usage is a dependency in which one named element (client) requires another named element (supplier) for its full definition or implementation.
            ![Usage](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-core/class-dependency-usage.png)
            * The abstraction relates two elements representing the same concept but at different levels of abstraction.
             * **Abstrct**
                * Abstraction is a dependency relationship that relates two named elements or sets of named elements representing the same concept but at different levels of abstraction or from different viewpoints.

            * **Interface**
              ```cpp
              @startuml
              class SearchService
              SiteSearch()-SearchService
              @enduml
              ```
            ![interface](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams/class-interface-realization-ball.png)

    * **Object Diagram**
      * UML 2.4 specification simply provides no definition of object diagram except that "the following nodes and edges are typically drawn in an object diagram: Instance Specification and Link (i.e., Association)."
      ![Obeject Diagram](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams/object-diagram-overview.png)

    * **Component Diagrams**
      * Component diagram shows components, provided and required interfaces, ports, and relationships between them.

      ![Component](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/component-diagrams/component-diagram-overview.png)
      ```cpp
      @startuml
      skinparam componentStyle uml2

4. **Behavior Diagram**
    * Behavior diagrams show the dynamic behavior of the objects in a system.

   |Diagram|Purpose|Elements|
   |:---:|---|:---:|
   |Use case diagram|Describes a set of actions (use cases) that some system or systems (subject) should or can perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system (actors) to provide some observable and valuable results to the actors or other stakeholders of the system(s). Note, that UML 2.4.1 specification (see "16.4 Diagrams") stated that Use Case Diagrams are a specialization of Class Diagrams such that the classifiers shown are restricted to being either Actors or Use Cases. Class diagrams are structure diagrams.|use case, actor, subject, extend, include, association.|
   |State machine diagram|	Used for modeling discrete behavior through finite state transitions. In addition to expressing the behavior of a part of the system, state machines can also be used to express the usage protocol of part of a system. These two kinds of state machines are referred to as behavioral state machines and protocol state machines.|
   |Interaction diagram|	Interaction diagrams include several different types of diagrams:<br> - sequence diagrams,<br> - communication diagrams (known as ollaboration diagrams in UML 1.x),<br> - timing diagrams,<br> - interaction overview diagrams.||
   |Sequence diagram|Most common kind of interaction diagrams which focuses on the message interchange between lifelines (objects).|lifeline, execution specification, message, combined fragment, interaction use, state invariant, destruction occurrence.|

  * **Use Case Diagram**
    * to describe a set of actions (use cases) that some system or systems (subject) should or can perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system (actors)
    * (System) Use case diagrams are used to specify:
      * (external) requirements, required usages of a system under design or analysis (subject) - to capture what the system is supposed to do;
      * the functionality offered by a subject – what the system can do;
      * requirements the specified subject poses on its environment - by defining how environment should interact with the subject so that it will be able to perform its services.
    ![UseCase](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/use-case-diagrams/use-case-diagram-elements.png)

   * **State machine diagram**
     * State machine diagram is a behavior diagram which shows discrete behavior of a part of designed system through **finite state transitions(FSM)**.
     * The following nodes and edges are typically drawn in state machine diagram: behavioral state, behavioral transition, protocol state, protocol transition, different pseudostates.

       ![StateMarchin](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/behavioral-state-machine-frame.png)

      * UML protocol state machine diagrams are used to express a usage protocol or a lifecycle of some classifier.
      ![STM](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/state-machine-diagrams/protocol-state-machine-diagram-overview.png)

   * **Sequence diagram**
     * Sequence diagram is the most common kind of interaction diagram, which focuses on the message interchange between a number of lifelines.

     ![SeqDiagram](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/sequence-diagrams/sequence-diagram-overview.png)
     * The following nodes and edges are typically drawn in a UML sequence diagram: lifeline, execution specification, message, combined fragment, interaction use, interaction use, continuation, destruction occurrence.

       * Lifeline
         * Lifeline is a named element which represents an individual participant in the interaction.
       * Gate
         * A gate is a message end, connection point for relating a message outside of an interaction fragment with a message inside the interaction fragment.
       * execution(execution specification)
         * A period in the participant's lifetime when it is executing a unit of behavior or action within the lifeline,
         * sending a signal to another participant,
         * waiting for a reply message from another participant.
       * message(Message occurrence)
         * An occurrence which represents such events as sending and receiving of signals or invoking or receiving of operation calls.
       * combined fragment
         * alt - alternatives

          ![alt](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-operator-alt.png)
         * opt - option

         ![opt](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-operator-opt.png)

         * loop - iteration

         ![loop](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-loop-fixed.png)
         * break - break

         ![break](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-operator-break.png)
         * par - parallel

         ![par](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-operator-par.png)
         * strict - strict sequencing

         ![strict](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-operator-strict.png)
         * seq - weak sequencing

         ![seq](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-operator-seq.png)
         * critical - critical region

         ![critical](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-operator-critical.png)
         * ignore - ignore

         ![ignore](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-operator-ignore.png)
         * consider - consider

         ![consider](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-operator-consider.png)
         * assert - assertion

         ![assert](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-operator-assert.png)
         * neg - negative

         ![alt](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/notation/sequence-operator-neg.png)
       * Interaction use
         * Interaction use is an interaction fragment which allows to use (or call) another interaction.
