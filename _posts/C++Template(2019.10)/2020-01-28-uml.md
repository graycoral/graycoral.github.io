## UML(Unified Modeling Language)

1. **Purpose**
   * modeling business and similar processes
   * analysis, design, and implementation of software-based systems
   * The current version is UML 2.5

2. **Classification of UML**
    ![Classification of UML](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/uml-25-diagrams.png)

3. **Struct Daigrams**
   * **static structure** of the system and its parts on different abstraction and implementation levels and how those parts are related to each other.
   * The elements in a structure diagram represent the **meaningful concepts of a system**, and may include abstract, real world and implementation concepts.

   |Diagram|Purpose|Elements|
   |:---:|---|:---:|
   |Class diagram|Shows structure of the designed system, subsystem or component as related classes and interfaces, with their features, constraints and relationships - associations, generalizations, dependencies, etc.|class, interface, feature, constraint, association, generalization, dependency.|
   |Object diagram|	Instance level class diagram which shows instance specifications of classes and interfaces (objects), slots with value specifications, and links (instances of association). Object diagram was defined in now obsolete UML 1.4.2 Specification as "a graph of instances, including objects and data values. <br>A static object diagram is an instance of a class diagram; it shows a snapshot of the detailed state of a system at a point in time." It also stated that object diagram is "a class diagram with objects and no classes." UML 2.5 specification simply provides no definition of object diagram.|instance specification, object, slot, link.|
   |Package diagram|Shows packages and relationships between the packages.|package, packageable element, dependency, element import, package import, package merge.|
   |Model diagram|UML auxiliary structure diagram which shows some abstraction or specific view of a system, to describe architectural, logical or behavioral aspects of the system. It could show, for example, architecture of a multi-layered (aka multi-tiered) application - see multi-layered application model.|model, package, packageable element, dependency.|
   |Component diagram|Shows components and dependencies between them. This type of diagrams is used for Component-Based Development (CBD), to describe systems with Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA).|component, interface, provided interface, required interface, class, port, connector, artifact, component realization, usage.|

    * Class Diagram
      * Class diagram is UML structure diagram which shows structure of the designed system at the level of classes and interfaces, shows their features, constraints and relationships
        * associations, generalizations, dependencies, etc.
        * Some common types of class diagrams are:
          * Domain model diagram
          * ![Classification of UML](https://www.uml-diagrams.org/class-diagrams/class-diagram-domain-overview.png)
          * Diagram of implementation classes.

        * Interface
            ```cpp
            class SiteSearch<<interface>>
            ```

            ```plantuml
            @startuml
            class SiteSearch<<interface>>
            @enduml
            ````

    * Object Diagram
      * Object diagram could be considered as instance level class diagram which shows instance specifications of classes and interfaces (objects), slots with value specifications, and links (instances of association).
      * Object diagram is "a class diagram with objects and no classes."
      * UML 2.4 specification simply provides no definition of object diagram except that "the following nodes and edges are typically drawn in an object diagram: Instance Specification and Link (i.e., Association)."

1. **Behavior Diagram**
    * Behavior diagrams show the dynamic behavior of the objects in a system.

   |Diagram|Purpose|Elements|
   |:---:|---|:---:|
   |Use case diagram|Describes a set of actions (use cases) that some system or systems (subject) should or can perform in collaboration with one or more external users of the system (actors) to provide some observable and valuable results to the actors or other stakeholders of the system(s). Note, that UML 2.4.1 specification (see "16.4 Diagrams") stated that Use Case Diagrams are a specialization of Class Diagrams such that the classifiers shown are restricted to being either Actors or Use Cases. Class diagrams are structure diagrams.|use case, actor, subject, extend, include, association.|
   |State machine diagram|	Used for modeling discrete behavior through finite state transitions. In addition to expressing the behavior of a part of the system, state machines can also be used to express the usage protocol of part of a system. These two kinds of state machines are referred to as behavioral state machines and protocol state machines.|
   |Interaction diagram|	Interaction diagrams include several different types of diagrams:<br> - sequence diagrams,<br> - communication diagrams (known as ollaboration diagrams in UML 1.x),<br> - timing diagrams,<br> - interaction overview diagrams.||
   |Sequence diagram|Most common kind of interaction diagrams which focuses on the message interchange between lifelines (objects).|lifeline, execution specification, message, combined fragment, interaction use, state invariant, destruction occurrence.|
