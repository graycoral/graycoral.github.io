## UML(Unified Modeling Language)

1. **Purpose**
   * modeling business and similar processes
   * analysis, design, and implementation of software-based systems
   * Version Of UML
     * The current version of the Unified Modeling Languageâ„¢ is UML 2.5, released in June 2015

2. **Classification of UML**
    * ![Classification of UML](/assets/classification_of_uml_2_5.png)

3. **Struct Daigrams**
   * Structure diagrams show **static structure** of the system and its parts on different abstraction and implementation levels and how those parts are related to each other.
   * The elements in a structure diagram represent the meaningful concepts of a system, and may include abstract, real world and implementation concepts.

   |:---:|:---:|:---:|
   |Class diagram|Shows structure of the designed system, subsystem or component as related classes and interfaces, with their features, constraints and relationships - associations, generalizations, dependencies, etc.|class, interface, feature, constraint, association, generalization, dependency.|
   |Object diagram|	Instance level class diagram which shows instance specifications of classes and interfaces (objects), slots with value specifications, and links (instances of association). Object diagram was defined in now obsolete UML 1.4.2 Specification as "a graph of instances, including objects and data values. A static object diagram is an instance of a class diagram; it shows a snapshot of the detailed state of a system at a point in time." It also stated that object diagram is "a class diagram with objects and no classes." UML 2.5 specification simply provides no definition of object diagram.|instance specification, object, slot, link.|
   |Package diagram|Shows packages and relationships between the packages.|package, packageable element, dependency, element import, package import, package merge.|
   |Model diagram|UML auxiliary structure diagram which shows some abstraction or specific view of a system, to describe architectural, logical or behavioral aspects of the system. It could show, for example, architecture of a multi-layered (aka multi-tiered) application - see multi-layered application model.|model, package, packageable element, dependency.|
